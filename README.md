## User Stories
**Required:**
* [x] User can tap through the 3 welcome screens
* [x] User can follow the create user flow
* [x] User can follow the sign in flow

**Optional:**
* [x] Add a detail view for one of the files and implement favoriting the file

**Additional** 
* Paging control stays in one location and updates when scrolling through pages
* When favoriting a file in one view control, the image view in another view controler is updated by passing data through NSNotificationCenter

## Notes

Had trouble getting page controls working based on how assignment laid it out, but was able to get it to work using another tutorial and a hack to hide static page control in assets.
